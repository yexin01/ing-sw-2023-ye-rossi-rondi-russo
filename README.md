## HOW TO START THE GAME
Inside the "deliverables" directory there are two folders - `jar for Windows and MacOs Intel` and `jar for Windows and MacOs M1` - each containing a single jar file `ing-sw-2023-ye-rossi-rondi-russo.jar`. 

It is highly recommended to use a jar specifically built for your operative system.

In order to run the jar and start the game, you first need to type `java -jar ing-sw-2023-ye-rossi-rondi-russo.jar` in the command line.

*Note*: You must be inside the directory where the jar file is placed `cd *path_to_directory`.

<sub>Example for macOS terminal</sub>
```
cd /Users/Player/Downloads
java -jar ing-sw-2023-ye-rossi-rondi-russo.jar it.polimi.ingsw.Start
```

<sub>Example for Windows terminal</sub>
```
C:\Users\Player\Download
java -jar .\ing-sw-2023-ye-rossi-rondi-russo.jar
```

### SERVER
The server can be created by typing `0` after running the jar. 

You need to type the port and the ip on which the server will accept connections.

### CLIENT
The client can be instantiated by typing `1` after running the jar. Then you can choose between CLI and GUI:

- CLI

The CLI can be run by inserting `0` after running the jar. 

For the best game experience, it is suggested to run the CLI on a default Mac power shell or on Windows Terminal for Windows users.

Then you need to insert your nickname (2-20 characters) and the desired connection (port and ip for socket/RMI).

Inside the global lobby, you will be able to create a new lobby or join a specific/random lobby.

*Note*: It is highly recommended to use a black background power shell to fully enjoy the CLI functionalities.

<sub>Example of CLI</sub>

<sub>Example turn phases in game.</sub>
<sub>Notice the separation in actions for each phase of the game.</sub>


- GUI

The GUI can be run by inserting `1` after running the jar.

For the best game experience, it is suggested to run the GUI in full-size window on a 1920x1080 resolution.

Then you need to insert your nickname (2-20 characters) and set it.

Now you will be able to set up the desired connection: insert port and ip on the corresponding row.

Inside the global lobby, you will be able to create a new lobby or join a specific/random lobby.
